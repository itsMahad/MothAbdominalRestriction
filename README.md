These code are used to track trejectory parameters of moth flight videos <br />
Step codes are the main video processing codes. Videos are broken down into their component frames and the position of the moth is calculated <br />
M_X codes are the motion processing codes. Tracked positions are used to elucidate flight parameters of moths <br /> 
A_X codes are auxillary codes used for visualization of flight video analysis <br />
